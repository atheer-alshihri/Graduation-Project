"This project ,we'll talk about a recommendation system that uses NLP (Natural Language 
Processing) and ML (Machine Learning) to categorize resumes. This clever system ranks 
resumes and job vacancies in the CVS format because when a person sorts and collates a batch 
of resumes, it takes time and effort.
In this project, we propose a system for extracting important information, processing data 
within the document, and removing unwanted data using NLP (Natural Language Processing), 
then our system analyzes many resumes and work documents using ML (Machine Learning) 
which helps to classify the data, in addition to Inclusion of words allows words with similar
meanings to be used to represent a word. TF-IDF extracts important words for us in the text 
and after performing operations on the algorithms it gives the decision to recommend a 
candidate because this system classifies the CV based on job vacancies."
